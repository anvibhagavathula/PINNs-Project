        - Need to find way to load and save models for Jax, current models take ~12min to train. 
        Potential solution: https://github.com/google/flax/discussions/1876 Would need to be able to 
        toggle between retraining and loading at will. Considering we aren't using flax, we might
        want to save /load models via pickle instead: 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64550792/how-do-i-save-an-optimizer-state-of-jax-trained-model
        Jax doesn't have native support for loading and saving models, so we will need to either use
        other libraries or we could save the weights and biases in a list format and then write a script 
        in which we initialize the model with the saved weights and biases.  
        Fix: See runner.py for more information.
                Notes: 
                - Will need to separate the model builder from the visualiser in this doc.
                - Will try and immitate the code from HW5
                - Need to restructure code into classes to allow this. Current code slightly unreadable.
                - Incomplete burgers_model.py revamp.
                - runner.py hasn't been started.
