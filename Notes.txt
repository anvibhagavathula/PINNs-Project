        - Need to find way to load and save models for Jax, current models take ~12min to train. 
        Potential solution: https://github.com/google/flax/discussions/1876 Would need to be able to 
        toggle between retraining and loading at will. Considering we aren't using flax, we might
        want to save /load models via pickle instead: 
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64550792/how-do-i-save-an-optimizer-state-of-jax-trained-model
        Jax doesn't have native support for loading and saving models, so we will need to either use
        other libraries or we could save the weights and biases in a list format and then write a script 
        in which we initialize the model with the saved weights and biases.  
        Fix: See run_saved_model.py for more information.
                Notes: 
                - Will need to separate the model builder from the visualiser in this doc.
                - Need to restructure code into classes to allow this. Current code slightly unreadable.
    


        - TypeError: error message below. Error probably coming from plt.figure(1.0, 1.1) on line 236.
        Likely stemming from latent error of "ImportError: cannot import name 'newfig' from 'plotting'". 
        Tried to solve using: https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs/issues/36
        Ultimately 'solved' by commented out the import line (line 17) and replaced it with line 18. 
        Newfig doesn't appear in the matplotlib documentation so thought it was referring to plt.figure 
        instead. Note: plotting seems to be an import from matplotlib.pyplot but not extremely clear either.
